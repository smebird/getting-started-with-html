  <H1>Unit 1: Basics of the Web</H1> 
  <h2>What is the web?</h2>
  <p>The web is a bunch of computers that communcate with each other.</p>
  <h2>How does the web work?</h2>
  <P>The web has four main components:</P>
  <b>(1) You:</b> You want to visit a web page<br>
  <b>(2) Your computer plus a Browser:</b> Your browser makes a request via the internet <br>
  <b>(3) The internet:</b> Sends an HTTP request to a server<br>
  <b>(4) Servers:</b> Locates appropriate HTML document and sends it back to your computer<br>
  where your web browser interprets the page and displays it on your computer screen
  <h2>What is a web page?</h2>
  <p>A web page is a document written in a language called HTML.  Web browsers<br>
    read these documents, and the interpret and display them.  
  </p>
  <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
  <p><b>HTML</b> (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage) is the heart of the web.
  </p>
  <p>HTML is made up of:</p>
  -- Text content (What you see)<br>
  -- Markup (What the text looks like)<br>
  -- References to other documents (eg: images, videos, etc...)<br>
  -- Links to other pages
  <p>Basic HTML vocabulary you should know:</p>
  
  <!-- I honestly couldn't figure this out from the videos, so I looked up an explanation at
  http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200508/html_tags_vs_elements_vs_attributes/ . I am 
  copying-rewording the explanation from that web page-->
  
  <b>Element:</b> A structure in HTML that consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.<br>
  <b>Tags:</b> Tags mark the beginning and end of an Element.  They are made of a less-than <br>
  symbol, followed by the Element's name, followed by a greater-than symbol.<br>
  <b>Attributes and values:</b>  Attributes follow tags and point to a value. Examples are<br>
  images and links to other web pages<br><br>
 <em> Elements can be either <em><b>inline</b></em> (effecting just the text enclosed by tags), or 
  <b>block</b> <br>(block elements have an invisible box around them with height and 
  width that separates<br> them from any other element).<br>
  While most Elements have both an <em><b>opening</b></em> and <em><b>closing</b></em> tag,  
  some Elements use only one tag<br> and are referred to as <b>void.</b></em><br> 
  <h2>A Couple Other Points to Remember:</h2>
  
  <h3>Computers are stupid</h3>
  Why?  Because they interpret instruction literally.  If you use the wrong Element<br>
  name in your opening tag or make a typo, a computer cannot "know" what you intended. 
  <br> A program will only work if the instructions are clear and the grammar correct.
  <h3>There Is Far Too Much to Remember</h3>
 Don't try to memorize every single fact.  Instead, concentrate on understanding<br>
 how programming languages work, and rely on the internet to remind you of an <br>
 Element's name or a particular structure.
